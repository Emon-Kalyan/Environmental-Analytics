Every time I get an infection, my right maxillary sinus swells up like a balloon. Sleeping at night on account of this condition is terribly difficult; I often have to resort to using Afrin to decongest my sinuses, which is effective but also very painful and not a realistic, long term solution because of rebound congestion. Now I already irrigate with a motorized system, often upwards of 8-10X daily when I'm sick, and drinking herbal tea has also become a pasttime to help cope with my sinus disease. That being said, I bought this tea out of sheer desperation. I'll try (and have tried) next to anything to give myself some relief while I wait for antibiotics to take effect. The only thing which I find works even close to as well as Afrin is to megadose on Psuedoephedrine (240 1-2 times per day), which is something that is also unsustainable. So, keep in mind that the severity of my sinus condition is drastic. What I found with this tea is that it seems to help, but I can't tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims (Yogi's Breathe Deep and Cold Buster, Celestial Sleepytime Sinus Soother, and other respiratory-aiding herbal formulations). I've brewed it double-strong to try and gain the greatest effect, and again, it seems to work modestly but nothing amazing. The taste is a little bitter, but I suppose that's a fairly reasonable indicator it has beneficial compounds in it. All in all, I am likely to stick with the less exotic teas that I can buy at the grocery store. As an aside, I find Celestial's Sweet and Spicy herbal mix to have probably the best mucus thinning effect out of all the teas I've tried, though it's not at all marketed as something for this purpose.

But if you have a smaller dog (I also have a Yorkie), these treats are just way too large.<br /><br />They are about two inches long and one inch wide (with a perforation in the middle). They contain organic ingrediants including carrots, apples and molasses, rather than fillers like corn meal.  They are relatively easy to break at the perforation - but really hard to break down further (though a hammer works well).  My Yorkie looked down at the treat then looked up at me with an expression of ""you gotta be kidding me"" and stared at me until I gave him one of his regular treats.<br /><br />The only drawback is that unless they are purchased in bulk, they are a bit expensive, so I would not use them as a training treat.

These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.""<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.""<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.""<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field.

I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.<br /><br />With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.<br /><br />The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.<br /><br />Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality.

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%",Positive,,,Price,0.149135818,0.110411756,0.18847776,0.243112709,0.104020875,0.273556676,0.139217401,0.273556676,6,Price,Train,,,
275,275,15627,B000255OIG,XXX,XXX,0,0,5,1339459200,Great treat to use as a high value reward!,"My 4 month old aussie loves these! Whenever he's fixated on something (like another dog while we're on a walk), I quickly wave it near his head to redirect his attention. It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA.

Do you pull off the cookie bottom first? Any way you eat it, Mallomars are a great cookie.<br /><br />Ordering them mail order is not the best way to get them. They are a fragile cookie and are very temperature (heat and cold) sensitive. The ones I received were fresh, but a little banged up.

But, WOW, am I glad I did. This tea has so much more flavor, is so much more delicate and lovely than Stash could ever hope to be. And this is decaf! Remember when you brew green tea - it is best to use water that isn't quite hot enough to boil - that keeps your cup of green tea from getting bitter. (Conversely, black and herbal teas are best made boiling water) Also, do not brew it too long - meaning, don't go longer than the recommended time noted in the box flap - or you'll release more tannins and experience slight bitterness. Personally, I brew mine on the weak side (3 minutes) with not quite boiling water, I add 1/2 tsp of sugar, and milk .... pure heaven in a cup. Lovely fragrance, taste, and aftertaste. Others might say milk overpowers green tea, but I enjoy it. I believe this tea only contains 5 mg of caffeine per cup (decaf is never 100% free of caffeine) so you may drink it at night without worry about staying up all night, or if you doc recommends cutting down on caffeine, or if you simply want to give your tummy a break from irritating caffeine - this is the ticket.

I was not at all happy with this product.<br /><br />First, when I received this product, it had a plastic bag over the top. But it was completely open on the bottom and not sealed on at all. As a result, about a 1/3 of the shampoo leaked into the envelope.<br /><br />Second, I tried this product for about 5 days. I really liked the scent of this shampoo and was anxious to try it. But this shampoo is extremely thick and goopy. It is very hard to rinse completely out of your hair. Even though I was only using a quarter-sized amount at a time, this product left my hair very dull, heavy, and greasy looking. my hair is very thick and I have a lot of it, and it does tend to be oily, so I don't typically use conditioner. After several days, this prodct made my hair look like I hadn't washed for a while. Needless to say, I have stopped using this product and gone back to my old shampoo. I was not all happy with this product and wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />However, I let my mom try it and she just loves it. She has a lot of hair, but it is baby fine. Her hair tends to be flat and doesn't have much body. She said that it makes her hair feel a lot more full and soft. So results seem to depend on your hair type.

I first noticed little blood in her stool, and dog was visibly unwell.<br />I brought her to the vet immediately before they closed for the day, and did xrays, stool test, and all that.<br />Ended up with a $1600 vet bill, but at least a recovering dog that shouldn't have any long term health problems.<br />The treat basically was so hard the sharp edges was causing minor tearing the GI tract. My dog is a chewer too and she never swallows anything whole, and I was watching her as she ate.<br />I had given her bully sticks, raw hide before (about once or twice a week), and she had no problems.<br />It couldn't have been anything else either because she hasn't eaten anything else other than her dog food (Ziwipeak) in the past 3 days. Ziwipeak isn't a kibble diet either. It is jerky like meat which is very soft. No signs of anything else (like plastic or metal toys, etc) on her x-ray either. So yes, it is these Chickenstrips.<br /><br />Anyhow, I took a new one out of the packaging, and attempted to cut it with a pair of scissors.<br />The strip was so hard my scissors wouldn't cut through, especially where the vein/tendon/muscle fiber (or whatever that is) is.<br />I probably will need a penknife or a small saw to do the job.<br /><br />So yea I learned my lesson, and should have listened to what another reviewer said earlier.<br />I took my chances because this product had so many 5 star feedback, and I made my dog go through unnecessary and avoidable pains and hardship. And also landed myself with a $1600 vet bill (sigh...)<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't advice this to anyone. If you have a really big dog like a Mastiff or a Pit Bull, I can see how this is probably OK because the dog itself is big, so this treat is really small compared in size. I have a 10 pound dog, so yea. I still wouldn't recommend anyone risking any chances, well unless you think a few thousand dollars in vet bills is nothing and don't mind your dog going through all that pain.<br />From now on if I am giving any chicken treats, its gonna be freezed dried or I will just boil or steam some boneless chicken myself.<br />Lesson learned.

We use fresh kale all the time for our smoothies, but I haven't been able to get myself to eat ""raw"" kale, like just-picked-from-the-garden-that-we-use-for-our-smoothies kale. So when I saw this ""raw"" kale snack I thought, they're not really ""raw."" They are dehydrated (under 115&#730;F) and seasoned, to make them palatable. And they are DELICIOUS. I love them. I am hooked. They have a slight crunch, but not a chip crunch, more like a firm bite. My kids like the initial taste but don't like the aftertaste. I love the whole thing. The problem is that they only come in a 2.5 ounce clear plastic container (supposedly 2.5 servings), which I can easily eat in one sitting. "" If you look at the nutrition facts, you'll notice they're not totally healthy. They have 9 g of fat per serving, or 22.5 g of fat per container, which realistically is what I could eat at a time if I were hungry. They are also a bit pricey (I paid $7.50 for the one package). Surprisingly, Amazon's price is higher, so I'll have to buy them directly from Brad's website, or from Wegmans or Whole Foods. If these were cheaper, I'd buy them all the time.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

The change in her health has been amazing.<br /><br />She's about age 12 now. (She's a rescue cat abandoned by the original owner, so we guess she was maybe 2 when adopted.) We had been feeding her a commercial ""breeder"" food (Purina Pro Plan Salmon & Rice). She was gaining fat and getting sluggish. Her blood panel showed her to be pre-diabetic, with possible kidney issues looming.<br /><br />After researching, we learned that nearly all cat kibble was dangerously high in carbohydrates and relatively low in protein, and that the protein sources were mediocre.<br /><br />Since cats are obligate carnivores, the inclusion of too much carbohydrate does just what it does to humans as we age: It is converted to fat and stored against a possible future of hunger. Unfortunately, this carries the risk of Type 2 Diabetes and other obesity-related illnesses.<br /><br />Also, poor-quality food sources injure the immune system, placing cats at risk for allergies and thyroid problems.<br /><br />It was clear that the high carbohydrate formula was putting our cat at risk. Our research also listed a number of high-protein, low-carbohydrate formulae. We chose Nature's Instinct Rabbit, which is 40% protein and 7% carbohydrate.<br /><br />Within two months, she slimmed down, losing about 20% body weight. She became more alert, spending more time awake and hanging out with us. She became more frisky, sometimes acting like a kitten. Her coat shines and she has that sleek look. Her gait has improved, because she doesn't have to turn her hindquarters out to get her legs around a bulging midsection. Her teeth, gums, and claws look healthy. All other factors, like living situation, have remained constant. The only change was her food.<br /><br />Her annual check-up isn't for two months, but all the signs indicate that her health has improved significantly since changing her diet.<br /><br />Yes, this kibble costs more by weight than commercial brands. But if you look at the total costs involved - vet bills, monthly diabetes or thyroid medicine cost, etc. - and the fact that she eats less quantity while deriving more nutrient intake, Nature's Instinct Rabbit is an investment in your cat's health and an overall excellent value.",Positive,,,zz,0.136075265,0.078057255,0.163513453,0.228056806,0.14129103,0.156681547,0.143630407,0.228056806,4,Nutrition,,,,

My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.",Negative,,,zz,0.228118548,0.105302313,0.215910164,0.263259569,0.138893234,0.17645593,0.170555389,0.263259569,4,Nutrition,,,,

If you have tried Illy Italy brand, the bean in most cases with the red cap is also brown beans for espresso. I tried it a few ways, in my aeropress, expresso machine, and coffee maker.<br /><br />Aeropress - I did two scoops of beans.  A little crema on top.  It was very good and nice and strong.<br /><br />Coffee Maker - No crema and was a little watery. I wouldn't recommend this for regular coffee makers, but if thats all you have, its still tastes good if you want a strong expresso coffee. I would recommend the Aeropress for single cups of pressed coffee especially with espresso beans.<br /><br />Espresso machine - Again, really nice flavor coffee with lots of crema on the top.

Fortunately, Amazon is making it right but I am saddened by this problem with planters.<br /><br />Jan 8, 2012: Update, for a while in 2011 there were bad patches of these nuts where for some reason the hot chili pepper was missing making the flavor subpar - there are several reviews mentioning this and I have personally experienced a few of these packs which I could not enjoy. Anyway, last week I received my latest Subscribe and Save order from Amazon and I am pleased to report that the tried and true recipe was used for that batch - dated best by 7-31-12.<br /><br />My favorite snack is nuts, particularly pistachios, almonds, cashews and peanuts - Yes, I know peanuts are not nuts but a legume. This particular variety of planters nuts are my favorite and can be hard to find, especially now that they have all these new designer flavors, most of which I just don't like at all. Chipotle has an aftertaste I don't enjoy and the other new flavors are too strong or too salty. The regular, honey roasted and heat nuts are the only varieties I enjoy. Heat nuts are not too hot, but certainly not mild. The hot spices heat up the taste of a roasted peanut instead of masking it.<br /><br />Nuts are far more nutritious than potato chips or pretzels which are mostly empty calories. Nuts are also loaded with fat, good fat, which makes you feel full instead of spiking your insulin levels like non-fat snacks do. But keep in mind a few nuts contain plenty of calories and it is easy to just keeping eating your way to the next size pants. The good news is that each packet, about 300 calories, makes for good portion control. Eat one pack and stop. Amazon has a great price and free shipping.

Black sludgewater. Horrible, and should be against the law to sell it. The only use for this junk I can see is to sprinkle it around the house dry -- 'cause it smells nice while dry.

Since the switch to Natural Balance, I realized how much they disliked the old food, because they actually get excited when I fill up the food dish and they look happier when they eat.  I now realize that they only ate the Beneful because that's all they had.  Imagine eating something you thought was gross for years on end.  I felt so bad.  I'll never switch back!  This food actually fills them up faster, so I actually spend about the same amount of money as I did on Beneful.  The better quality ingredients fill them up faster.  I am converted for life.  It's extra money, but it's so worth it to know that my dogs are healthy, happy, and full.  Plus, Duke poops like a champ now.",Positive,,,zz,0.184241753,0.118615622,0.149390662,0.192066915,0.121910126,0.18410768,0.158856565,0.192066915,4,Nutrition,,,,
794,794,209100,B00004RAMY,XXX,XXX,4,4,5,1255046400,It does what the reviews said,"Our yard was COMPLETELY overrun with moles this year.  The lawn was dead and the trails were everywhere we walked--literally.  We tried sulphur bombs (the Giant Destroyer), spring traps, castor oil (lots of it), Talpirid (80 worms), sonic molechasers (13 of them on 3/4 acre--way more than was suggested), and finally a professional mole guy which cost us $450 to place poison bait (all we got from that is a sick cat and a $150 vet bill), but no dead moles.  Killing grubs doesn't work because their main love is earthworms and you definitely don't want to kill those.  Everything that you read says that trapping is the only way to truly rid yourself of moles.  They only reproduce once a year and usually have litters of 3 to 4 pups--and half of them die.  The only reason we get overrun by them is from not trapping them and using deterrents that only work for short periods of time, allowing their numbers to increase (from what I've read). I read about this product and all the great reviews and I chose to *believe* one last time, so I ordered 6 of them. We went outside this afternoon to set 2 of the traps and within 1 hour we had our first mole!!!  He was huge and very well fed, he lived a good life. RIP.<br /><br />Initially, we did get completely frustrated and we each threw one across the yard, then we calmed down and figured it out. The reviewers all had great tips and I re-read them.  The thing to remember is to set the trap and put the safety on BEFORE you try and put it in the ground (sounds obvious, but it seemed easier to place it in the ground first and it wasn't). The spring is VERY strong, but the metal bars they put in the package make it easy enough to open the trap with both hands, then hold it open with one hand, and keeping the plate near the ground for leverage, engage the pin on the striking plate and flip the locking pin over.  The only other hard part is finding the right type of tunnel!<br /><br />I'm convinced there is no ""natural* way to get rid of moles--I wish there was--but the only thing that is ultimately going to work is trapping them.  Be patient and don't give up, it really is easy to set this trap once you get the hang of it.  GOOD LUCK!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/2009:  Just caught another one this morning!  The trails are dwindling...<br /><br />UPDATE 5/2010:  Our grass finally grew back in after the moles killed every square inch of the lawn last year. We ended up getting about 5 moles. Just got the traps out again for the summer season as we noticed a small area being dug up.  We found a straight trail, set the trap and caught him within 4 hours!",Positive,,,zz,0.227912239,0.161043891,0.225772873,0.251333446,0.175482838,0.174274111,0.152036231,0.251333446,4,Nutrition,,,,

This brand, the PanTai brand in the foil pouch, is milder with less body and richness.  The color brews more orangey while the Por Kwan is darker and can be orangish to the color of fresh brewed coffee. The Por Kwan brand defintely is more full bodied and richer.  It has black thai leaves, panden leaves and lemon grass.  I wrote a great review on it.  The PanTai brand has a slight cinnamony taste to it and is lighter in flavor.  I've grown to really enjoy Thai Tea in general and some restaurants seem to have the darker, more robust flavor kind and others have the lighter milder cinnamony tasting kind. I guess it all depends on what you want for your taste buds.<br /><br />I was in one of my favorite Thai restaurants the other day and I asked the owner to show me the kind of tea that she serves her customers.  She showed me this brand, the exact package that is shown and selling at Amazon.  The tea she serves is this PanTai brand and tasted milder than Por Kwan and less variable in its flavor but it was still good.  So I realize it isn't the way I was making the tea, it is the way the tea just is.  If you just want a cup of thai tea, this seems to do the trick.  But I really like the flavor of the Por Kwan much more because it has a deeper, richer, flavorful taste and even a better aroma than the PanTai.  But I think it is still a good tea and has its place, especially when eating hot spicy thai food, it is a good balance as it complements the food well.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

A tip for anyone just introducing a new food to your kitty:  Introduce the food slowly by mixing just a little of the new food with the old food.  Increase the amount each time you feed the kitty eventually eliminating the quantity of the previous food.

Some Internet research uncovered that it is blended for Harrod's by Williamson, so I tracked down their Earl Grey which was then avaliable on two US websites.  It is even better than Harrod's.  Harrod's Earl Grey, by the way, is best purchased as you leave the UK.  There is a Harrod's store in the international departure area at Heathrow - they do not charge the 18% VAT.

I use an online calculator to find the proper amounts I need when working with tsp and tbsp requirements. That makes it pretty simple. I have totally stopped using sugar or any other sweeteners.

Your experience is important to us.<br /><br />BULL'S-EYE Original Barbecue Sauce is committed to bringing the flavor you enjoy, while minimizing the impact of rising commodity costs to ensure we're providing the best possible price to consumers.  To continue delivering the barbecue sauce you love we are now using high fructose corn syrup in all BULL'S EYE Original Barbecue Sauce.<br /><br />Product made with high fructose corn syrup can be identified by the ingredient statement on the back panel of the bottle.<br /><br />Our staff works very hard to provide the best tasting and satisfying products to the preferences of most consumers. Your opinion about the product is important to us as well and I will share your comments with our product development staff.<br /><br />Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts.<br /><br />Kim McMiller<br />Associate Director, Consumer Relations<br /><br />I say write to Kraft and let them know if you're unhappy with their decision.  I would be willing to pay a bit more to purchase sauce without HFCS.<br /><br />My original review follows:<br /><br />I love the taste of Bulls-Eye! I found out that I was on my last bottle of the 'original' - I like the other flavors as well - so I went by my local grocery, and I don't know why I looked on the ingredient list, but there at the top of the list, the main ingredient was High Fructose Corn Syrup! I was shocked. Didn't buy it of course, because besides the taste, I also love that I don't have to eat HFCS. I then checked the bottle I had at home. Unbelievably, my older bottle had no HFCS in it at all. So I'm savoring it for as long as I can until I can find a suitable replacement. What genius at the company took a ridiculously fantastic product and decided to ruin it?! Almost every BBQ sauce out there has HFCS in it, which is why I was so happy when I found Bull's-Eye.<br /><br />If you love Bull's-Eye as much as I do, please let the company know how much you enjoyed their original non-HFCS formula. It may be that this vendor still has some of the non-HFCS bottles, but I would check first. And if you can find bottles of the old recipe online, please post it so I can buy as much as possible until I can find another with great taste and no HFCS in it.

As far as cancer is concerned, it's one of the worst... prognosis is generally 4-6 weeks after diagnosis untreated, up to one year with chemo.  My husband and I decided we were not in a financial position to do chemo, especially to only buy our pooch one year, so I started researching alternative medicines.  One thing I read over and over was to switch to a grain-free diet.  Well, we had been feeding him decent food, but not grain-free.  So, I bought a bag of this.<br /><br />10 weeks later the tumors in his neck have shrunk without any medication, and you'd never know this dog has a death sentence.  He can digest it just fine, his coat looks great, he actually slimmed up a bit (which is great because he was a little chubby) and he just looks and feels fantastic.  I'm not saying this is a miracle cure-all and that the cancer won't get the best of him one day soon, but I am forever thankful to this company for making such high quality food that is making his time left easier and enjoyable.

They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.",Positive,,,zz,0.1261307,0.141922728,0.295976295,0.347080396,0.148357229,0.158751278,0.258809738,0.347080396,4,Nutrition,,,,

My dogs are healthy and fit because they run at least five miles a day and also go swimming fairly often.<br /><br />It's a bit of a hassle feeding raw, getting the balance right, having to keep a ""dog meat"" freezer, etc.  Also, I'm beginning to wonder how safe it is to feed them the meat of animals that have been injected with antibiotics, hormones, etc.  So I was motivated to change their diet.  You might imagine that it would be difficult to get dogs who are accustomed to eating raw meat to change to dry food, but there was no hesitation in my shepherds' acceptance of this food.  (I add water to the kibble so that they don't inhale the pieces.)<br /><br />My dogs are each about 95-97 pounds (and they aren't one bit fat!), which means they need to be fed about 3.5 cups of this dry food a day.  I have been buying the 30-pound bags.  To find out how far a bag would stretch, I measured out 3.5 cups of the food and weighed it.  It came to 0.914 pounds for 3.5 cups.  So a 30-pound bag will last for about 32 meals.  I will need to buy three 30-pound bags a month, which turns out to be not a bad price, to feed three 96-pound German shepherd dogs for a month.<br /><br />I'm impressed with the list of ingredients on the bag, as well, so I'm not as concerned about my dogs getting all the nutrients they need to be optimally healthy as I was when they were eating solely raw meat.<br /><br />Hope this review has been helpful.",Positive,,,zz,0.162627274,0.131764287,0.17289025,0.240186816,0.138858324,0.248314312,0.13783069,0.248314312,6,Price,,,,

These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

Even though i have always liked canned sardines, i just had stopped eating them years ago due to my unfounded fears about mercury levels (turns out sardines have among the lowest levels in the ocean for an omega-3 rich fish), and just plain laziness/ life getting in the way/ other things to eat....anyway, i digress.<br /><br />i looked on amazon and found a case of reese skinless boneless saltless in water (my husband is on a health kick), and roland skinless boneless saltless in water--both the cheapest on subscribe and save.  after ordering these two cases, i thought, well- i actually like oil packed. As an accommodation to my salt-avoiding husband, i also ordered the crown prince brisling oil/no salt.  BUT, just to round out my midnight sardine buying spree  (that one can- or maybe the Blue Planet series- really wet my appetite, i guess), i also ordered these Viga oily, salted, skin and bone fish for myself.<br /><br />ok. well.  i've eaten nearly (my husband stole some of one can as i was scarfing) 4 cans of the viga since yesterday when i got the shipment..... i know it's not good to have too many omega-3s, so i'll try to control myself now.  But,  YUUUUUUMMMMMM!!!!!!  i went back on-line today, and ordered what turns out to be the last case... sorry folks.  i'm really hoping Amazon brings these back.  i can't believe how delicious these Viga lemon are.  the slice of lemon (in the can, as noted by one reviewer) is similar to the moroccan preserved lemon (i love moroccan food)-very soft, very mild, nearly sweet lemon slice.  the flavor of the fish is a thing wonderously oily and richly satisfying- as only skin and bone can add, i believe.  Although I also liked all the other sardines i bought, the no oil, no salt, no skin and no bones....well, it's a health thing i guess- but i prefer those with hot sauce or onions or mustard, etc.... the reese and roland also tasted like tuna in a can- not bad for that kinda thing- i was thinking i'd need to actually mix them with mayo for a sardine-fish sandwich - again, not bad- still feels good after eating, but not something quite i'm craving-- unlike this viga with lemon.  i think i could eat this everyday, easily.  quite delicious.  Re: the brisling crown prince variety, i think those who like the size/shape and lightly smoked ""traditional"" flavor will like the crown prince.<br /><br />I enjoyed one review (can't remember which sardines) from a guy who mentioned that he started his cat on sardines, and that his cat is like a ""new cat.""  I love these so much--- i wonder if i'll become like a new cat?<br /><br />anyway, if you like, as another reviewer said, ""the real thing,""  i would highly recommend these.  Since i'm not an expert on spanish sardines, i just don't really know if these are not as complex as yet another reviewer noted (see other non-lemon Viga reviews)-  but, all my Viga cans and boxes were clean with expiration dates (unlike the reese) and, i thought they were just super scrumptious fabutastic.  if these are the less flavorful /less complex types of spanish sardines, i really will make an effort to try other varieties!",Positive,,,zz,0.223846576,0.13084656,0.334531345,0.300807955,0.206101849,0.243890782,0.200587423,0.334531345,3,Flavor/Taste,,,,

I appreciate a good-tasting, full-bodied tea and Stash has never let me down.  Being into Reiki and the energy stuff, I decided to try the Chanakara (Chakra) teas.

Regardless of whether you are into metaphysical energy or not, this is a very nice tea.  Besides having the health benefits of organic antioxidant-rich South African rooibos, it also has a smooth taste with a slight sweetness (as red tea does) and a light fruity taste--very pleasurable.  It is caffeine free.  I did not add sugar but if you do, I suggest a natural product like agave cactus nectar (natural foods isle of grocery stores) or the unbleached brown sugar (in the sugar isle of grocery stores).<br /><br />Other ingredients listed on the package are: Rosehips, Hibiscus, Raspberry Leaf, Uva Ursi (soothing), Citric Acid, and Natural Strawberry Flavor.

Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of ""Brian Amazon"" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since.

As a child, I hated it, but now I remember it fondly...isn't it weird how that happens? So good...strawberry shortcake is the most delicious thing in this world. Especially made with fresh, sun ripened strawberries. As long as I can remember, my mom has had a row or two of strawberries in her yard. When we lived in Michigan and we had room to garden (and soil that was more than just clay), we had tons of strawberries. Tons! But then we moved to Tennessee, and the soil there was not as habitable, but she still managed to squeeze some delicious berries out of that red clay. So strawberries and strawberry flavored things that actually taste like strawberries always remind me of her and of that gorgeous garden she kept in Michigan. Of course, they also remind me of the time I was about 7 and picking strawberries in the garden when I felt some grass brush over my foot. I looked down to see a snake slithering over my foot. **shudders** I have never screamed so loud in my life. And thus a lifelong fear of snakes was born.<br /><br />So the real question here is will this matcha be a snake or a shortcake?<br /><br />Shortcake. Oh my goodness, shortcake. This smelled amazing when I opened the package, like creamy, sweet strawberries. Like, well, strawberry shortcake, to be honest. Guh, I just want to dive into it. I took it to work with me and my mind was blown by it. I kept getting distracted by how good it was. I love a good tea. I'm trying to figure out which six I want to keep in stock and this is a definite front runner. I think mixing this with a little French Vanilla would be out of this world. I love berries so most of my smoothies are berry smoothies...this will be an amazing addition to that particular mix. Now, it doesn't have that hint of tartness that fresh strawberries do, but that's okay. I'm in love anyway. It tastes like strawberry candy, but I know Red Leaf Tea doesn't use artificial ingredients, so I'm very excited to have this. Next time I'm craving a bag of strawberry puffs, I'm going to reach for this instead.

1326,1326,411015,B001EPQTD2,XXX,XXX,1,1,5,1335571200,Does the Job,"MAKING YOUR OWN GELATIN DESERTS<br />As the package advises, you can make ""better Jello"" with Knox Gelatin and fruit juice.  This also gives you the opportunity to use the sweetener of your choice---or mixtures.  Although I use Pure Stevia <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84"">Pure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 oz</a> in my coffee, I find that Spenda tastes better with sour fruit juices <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIRYS"">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated, 1.2-Pound Bag</a>.  If you buy ""store bought"" juice---it usually has enough sugar in it for ordinary ""jello"", but if you add sour fruit, you need to oversweeten the gelatin.  This is a great way to use sour fruit which is not appealing to eat ""out of land"", and a great way to get kids to eat fruit.  Cold reduces the sensation of sweetness, so you need extra sweetener. Generally, I cube sour fruit and embed the fruit cubes in over-sweetened unflavored gelatin.  A layer of mixed fruit and berries in sweetened gelatin above vanilla pudding in a champaigne glass is a very special desert---and can be both low-calorie and healthy.<br /><br />The basic Knox recipe, gelatin/cup water (or juice) produces firm gelatin, firmer than jello (following the instructions).  You can make very firm ""jigglers"" for kids by doubling the gelatin.<br /><br />Be creative:  You can make ""iced tea"" gelatin, or coffee gelatin.  Sweet mint gelatin (made with fresh mint leaves) is very refreshing, a few embeded mint leaves and perhaps a few thin slices of strawberry can make it special.  Almost any non-sparkling beverage can make great gelatin.  Most adult ""mixed drinks"" can be gelled.  Can you imagine serving ""jello"" to your guests at a fancy dinner party, and then they find that it is fabulous?  Base your recipes on mixed drinks you like.  Almond ""jello"" made with Amaretto, perhaps with shaved almond on top, is a nice surprise.<br /><br />OTHER DESERTS<br />You can add gelatin to almost any puddling-like desert (including pies served cold) to make it firmer and more healthy.  I use Knox gelatin to make ""chocolate"" pudding with a tropical fruit called ""black sapote"".  In such cases it is best to make a very strong gelatin and water (or juice, or milk) mixture, and add that to the other ingredients.  If you try to mix the gelatin directly with the other ingredients, chances are that it won't dissolve property.  The rule is ""Make the gelatin first, and then add 'stuff' to it.""  Don't overdo the gelatin, most of these deserts are best ""thick creamy"" rather than ""chunky"".<br /><br />WORKING WITH KNOX GELATIN<br />Individuals who are used to jello may find Knox Gelatin difficult to use.  It isn't.  The trick is simply TIME.  Typically, I microwave 2 cups of fruit juice in a 4 cup measuring cup for 5 minutes---that gets it up to boiling or very near boiling.  Then sprinkle a little gelatin on the surface and stir, repeat until you've added all the gelatin.  At this point there will be many large globs of gelatin floating in the measuring cup.  DON'T PANIC. Just give it a little time.  Stir gently for several minutes, and you'll find most of the gelatin dissolved.  If you don't have the patience for that, then take out the garbage or do some other 5 minute chore.  After 5 minutes, you'll find that most of the remaining gelatin will dissolve with a little stirring.<br /><br />> Tempted to use a hand blender or cake mixer?  Don't. Mostly, that just makes a mess to cleanup.  However, I've found that a little mini-mixer works well and cleanup is easy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E39LYO"">Norpro Cordless Mini Mixer, 5 Piece Set</a>.<br />> Tempted to add the gelatin to a (puddling etc.) mixture and then heat the mixture?  Don't.  In my experience it is very hard to get the gelatin to dissolve.  Again: The rule is ""Make the gelatin first, and then add 'stuff' to it.""<br /><br />PREPARING FOR A COLONOSCOPY<br />Take a steak, cut into small strips, and then boil it to heck in 2-3 cups of water.  Add a tablespoon or so of Braggs Aminos instead of salt.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006Z7NNQ"">Bragg Liquid Amino - 32 oz - Liquid</a>  Strain.  Discard the boiled meat (or use it for cat/dog food). Chill the liquid.  Remove the solid layer of fat from the top.  Walla!! ""beef jello"" (aka jellied consumme).  Really! Gelatin is animal connective tissue---and there is lots of in a steak.  ""Beef jello"" is surprisingly satisfying and filling, and will easily hold you overnight until the terrifying ""event"" is over.  Obviously, beef jello is a terrific food for older folks who can't chew or have trouble swallowing.  You can also drink it hot as a broth, however chilling and gelling has the advantage of separating out the fat (on the top) and the fine solids (as a layer on the bottom) which could interfere with your colonoscopy.<br /><br />What does this have to do with Knox Gelatin?  The alternate (easier, faster) way to make ""beef jello"" is to dissolve gelatin in water and add bullion concentrate (beef bullion is the same thing as ""boiled to heck and then strained"" steak), and chill.  Bullion is already salty, so you don't need the Braggs. Or you can make ""chicken jello"".  If you are a vegetarian---well forget it---gelatin is an animal product, so just go with the beef or chicken ""extract"".<br /><br />SOUPS AND STEWS<br />Homemade broth from bones and scraps is the basis of great soup or stew, largely because of the ""body"" it adds to the soup.  You can use Knox gelatin for the same purpose---to add body. The soup will remain watery while hot, but and the gelatin per se has no flavor, but you'll notice the ""body"".  Make up a gelatin solution first, then add the soup ingredients.  Homemade broth also has alot of dissolved proteins, which enhances the flavor---you can use bullion or Braggs for this purpose.  Another important flavor component of good soup is fat. If you've chilled your broth and removed the animal fat, replace it with vegetable oil, ideally olive oil. I usually add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to a pot of soup or stew.  Most grocery store olive oil is harsh and bitter---but ironically, that adds complexity to soups and stews.  Colavita is a better general purpose olive oil which can be found in some better grocery stores, which is also great on salads, and even for dipping. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLB16"">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />To repeat: the key to good soup, stew, bean dishes, chili, etc. is: 1) gelatin, 2) dissolved protein, and 3) fat (vegetable oil).  You can get all these components by boiling meat scraps (including bones).  But you can also assemble ""broth"" from the ingredients (gelatin, dissolved protein, and fat) if you don't have home-made broth on hand.  Most people only think of making beef broth.  However, I save every chicken bone (along with the giblets) and freeze them until I have several quarts, and then I boil them for 6 hours or more (with a little white vinegar) to make chicken broth.<br /><br />If you are one of those strange people who likes an occassional bowl of broth made from bullion cubes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5ADG"">Herbox Beef Boullion Cube, 25-Cube Canister (Pack of 6)</a>---next time add a packet of Knox gelatin.<br /><br />FOR HAIR AND JOINTS<br />20 years ago I was diagnoised with arthritis in my hip, confirmed by x-ray, and had begun to get aches in my shoulders, knees and elbows. I began taking 1 citracal tablet <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LRPUMY"">Citracal Maximum Caplets with Vitamin D, 180-Count Bottle</a> and 1 glucosamine/chondroitin tablet daily <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V2JBEK"">Kirkland Signature Glucosamine HCI 1500mg Chondroitin Sulfate 1200mg 220 Tablets / New Increased Count</a>.  Now 20 years later, I'm a geezer without arthritis (or at least without symptoms).  I also take a biotin suppliment for my skin and nails <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BY2N7S"">NOW Foods Biotin 5000mcg, 120 Vcaps</a>.

1414,1414,444531,B004JRO8IK,XXX,XXX,1,1,5,1339372800,Description + Review,"Description:<br /><br />The manufacture website describes Batch 37 Spicy Trail Mix as the following:<br />""Now there's a snack mix for the true ""hot head"". Just one bite and you'll see this isn't an ordinary nibble. So hang on to your buds and try Mo's mouthwatering, eye-tearing trail mix.""<br /><br />However, this barely counts as a description, for starters, its based off the Batch 37 hot sauce, see:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DG5AO"">Pain Is Good, Batch #37 Hot Sauce, 6.7 fl oz</a>. It contains a mix of Peanuts,  Cajun Sesame Sticks, BBQ Corn Sticks, Almonds and Cashews, dusted in a nice smokey/salty Habanero BBQ seasoning. It contains Peanuts, Wheat, Soy, Milk, Cashews and Almonds so suffers of food allergies/intolerance be wary.  About 1/4 a cup equates to 160 calories, 110 from fat (Remember, this is mostly nuts, fatty but nearly as bad as it sounds on paper), and 115 mg of salt, 8g of carbs (only 1g from sugar), and 5g of protein... made in Kansas. The ""trail mix"" is a snack mix as there's an inherent lack of more standard trail mix ingredients like raisins/craisins/dried fruit/M&M/Chocolate that tend to comprise trail mix.<br /><br />Review:<br />There's not point to explaining hot food, either you like it or don't.<br /><br />Now that I got the boring stuff out the way, is it any good? Simply yes. I've eaten both Dave's Burning Nuts (known best for Dave's Insanity Sauce, a must try for hot heads) and Da Bomb Ghost Chili Nuts. Both are simply peanuts dusted in heat, which makes for nice but bland munching. I more or less bought these blind, and figured I might end up with 6 containers of unlikable nuts. However, its hardly the case. Comparing these to the other two aforementioned hot foods, these are easily the most desirable. Dave's Burning Nuts are neither hot enough nor special enough to warrant ordering online (in my opinion). Da Bomb Ghost Chili Nuts are pretty good, with a long lingering heat but sadly the seasoning can only be found on peanuts.  Pain is Good gets oodles more points for offering variety. While comprised primarily of peanuts, there's crunchy Sesame Sticks and Corn Sticks, the lone almond and the occasional cashew which keeps things more interesting. They also pack more flavor, the bits of cajun and competing flavors help keep this more complex and tasty.<br /><br /> As far a heat goes? I wish more companies used the Pain is Good metric. I was a bit disappointed to see these were only ""medium"" hot, but they're considerably hotter than Dave's Burning Nuts which Dave's rates as an underwhelming 7 out of 10. Fellow hot heads probably won't break a sweat even, although the zing probably is more than average person would care for. They're not quite as hot as the Da bomb nuts, but they're surprisingly hot... and tastier. It took a lot of restraint not to eat the entire 8 oz container in a single sitting. I'd like to see these kick up the heat a notch higher, but the heat is enough to make me happy, and excellent companion to your favorite beer.<br /><br />Will I buy these again? Most likely. I haven't bought a lot of food on Amazon.com but this is easily the best food stuff I purchased.",Positive,,,zz,0.181190818,0.16170431,0.312924838,0.266338428,0.175649754,0.186474526,0.215572052,0.312924838,3,Flavor/Taste,,,,

I haven't tried other sesame oils, but this is FANTASTIC.<br /><br />Some recipes call for extra virgin olive oil, but that makes a very strong flavored (disgusting!) mayo--I used that the first time I made mayo, and I just threw it away.  This sesame oil makes all the difference, though.<br /><br />This is the recipe that I used:<br /><br />---<br />1 farm fresh egg<br />1 cup extra virgin cold pressed sesame oil<br />1 Tbsp lemon juice<br />salt and pepper to taste<br /><br />1. In a large bowl whisk the egg.<br />2. In a thin, very slow stream, add the oil with one hand while continuing to whisk with the other hand.  A food processor can be used as an easier alternative to doing it by hand.<br />3. Whisk in all remaining ingredients.<br />4. Store refrigerated.<br />---<br /><br />I used my food processor.  And, today I made a second batch with half sesame oil, half coconut oil; it was still good.  I think the sesame oil really adds the perfect smell and taste to mayo.<br /><br />We've been using the mayo on toasted sourdough sandwiches with grilled meat and cheese, lettuce, tomato, and green peppers.  SO tasty!  It would make a perfect substitute for any store mayo, though.  (And it's way healthier, since it doesn't have hydrogenated oils and chemicals, etc.)<br /><br />I do think this would make a great addition to salad dressings or stir fry.

Lidded Glass teapot to view the spectacular blooming.  2 attractive, reusable and sustainable bamboo boxes (1 containing the individually wrapped flowers and a larger containing the whole kit and caboodle.  Amazon's price, which at wholesale is a steal for this type of handmade, artisan product.  And the sensory experience itself is priceless (though many a tea salon now have put a price on it).<br /><br />The Bad:  All selections do not quite yield 3 pots, and speaking of the pot, yes you may want to invest in a back-up.<br /><br />For the price, I haven't seen a better gift.  The nay sayers are looking for a product that would have to retail at twice the full retail value of this set.  And you don't like the flavors?  Isn't that a matter of personal taste?

Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right??  Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without.  It has made that important an improvement in my life.  It is almost like a miracle.  Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume.  Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.  In America this ratio is about 4 to 1.  Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1.  I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.  (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two.  You probably won't need that long.  I noticed an improvement in two days.  A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them.

Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, ""100 calorie packs"" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + ""ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"" & ""ARTIFICIAL COLORS"" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.",Positive,,,zz,0.124723687,0.127849083,0.240595896,0.287364999,0.154390813,0.161647632,0.20886512,0.287364999,4,Nutrition,,,,

1479,1479,469164,B000AQFQC6,XXX,XXX,9,11,5,1142294400,"Shirataki Oodles Of Noodles, Tofu-Styled","I expect 2006 to be a breakout year for shirataki noodles because people want to eat heathier and better by choosing foods that help them cut down on the carbs without sacrificing the taste and texture they adore. It's a delicate balance, but shirataki noodles are proving it can be done.<br /><br />I've already tried the Konjac brand of shirataki noodles and reviewed them for you last week. Now let me introduce you to another kind of shirataki noodles that are quite different from the Konjac brand. They're from a company called House Foods.<br /><br />House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are a unique combination of tofu and polysaccharide glucomannan (yam flour) to provide a genuinely authentic pasta texture that you frankly just don't get from the Konjac brand. I was extremely surprised by the House Foods brand and would definitely choose this brand over Konjac in a side-by-side comparison -- DEFINITELY!<br /><br />What's so different about the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles?<br /><br />For starters, each 4-ounce serving (2 servings per bag) has just 20 calories and a neglible 1g net carbs (3g total carbs minus 2g of dietary fiber). While that's not ZERO, it's certainly not bad, especially considering the trade-off you make in the texture of these noodles. These are perfect for every phase of livin' la vida low-carb for a nutritious and delicious pasta alternative.<br /><br />Also, they are sugar-free, gluten-free, cholesterol-free, dairy-free, and even have 10% calcium. What could be better?<br /><br />When I opened my bag of Noodle Shaped House Foods Tofu Shirataki for supper tonight, I immediately smelled the infamous fishy odor from them as I have come to expect from this product. But don't let that deter you away from enjoying the final version of this product, though, because the smell does go away quickly once you have rinsed them off and warmed them up for a few minutes either in boiling water or in the microwave.<br /><br />After draining the noodles in a collander, I transferred them to a bowl, sprinkled some garlic Alsosalt on them, and poured my favorite no sugar added spaghetti sauce on top. Mixing the noodles together with the sauce, I warmed it up in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Then I added some pepperoni slices and mozarella cheese on top and cooked it in the microwave for an additional minute. Mmmmmm. This looks so good!<br /><br />Voila! My low-carb House Foods Tofu Shirataki pasta dish was complete and it was time to eat.<br /><br />Since I had already tried another brand of shirataki noodles previously, I was expecting them to be similar when I put them in my mouth. But imagine my surprise when I started chewing and noticed they were soft like real pasta and weren't as ""chewy"" as the other brands. WOW! Check it out, this is AWESOME dude! Can you imagine shirataki noodles getting any better than this? My wife said they reminded her of Oodles of Noodles when she looked at them.<br /><br />House Foods has certainly found their niche in the shirataki noodles market and I applaud them for providing consumers with a unique choice. While the other brands of shirataki noodles certainly aren't bad products, the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are the only ones on the market today that provide the actual look and feel of real pasta without the carbs or calories! CONGRATULATIONS to them for doing such an excellent job with their products!<br /><br />And apparently the consumer seems to like House Foods Tofu Shirataki, too, because their Fettuccini Shaped and Noodle Shaped products are currently #1 and #2 respectively on the list of bestselling Gourmet Foods at Amazon.com. How about that?<br /><br />So go ahead, give 'em a try! All you have to lose is excess weight.

I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br /><br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo.

1521,1521,485103,B000F7A5X0,XXX,XXX,2,2,5,1329264000,Wonder food - best food for healthy cats!,"I've always fed my cats ""good"" food, per my vet's recommendations (Royal Canin (sp) or Science Diet). But I made a crazy mistake when my cats turned 7; given Science Diet recommends a switch to a geriatric food at age 7, I changed to the geriatric formula.  BAD decision. I have Siamese cats (boy weighed 9# and girl weighed 7#) - over the course of 9 months, they each lost about a pound, which is a LOT for these little guys!  Talked to my vet and he said my cats definitely did NOT need a geriatric diet yet.  They are extremely active, as are most Orientals.<br /><br />Instead of switching back to their old Science Diet, I asked friends who did rescue work and friends who were breeders for their recommendations: they all swore by Innova Evo.  I started my cats on it and they LOVED it - and put back on the weight they lost. I also increased the amount of wet food in my cats' diet, as they previously ate predominantly dry food diet with a small amount of wet food as a treat. The change had other positives: I noticed they were vomiting less than they had in the past and my male cat, who had long suffered with allergies got better.  (This was a big deal, as he has been through extensive testing and we've tried MANY foods to help his allergies.) The only negative is that my female cat, who always had the silkiest fur, lost some of the silk and luster in her fur.  I have no idea what Science Diet puts in the food that Innova Evo doesn't have, but there was a marked change. I talked to my vet and he put both of them on Fel-V omega-3 oils, and my little girl regained most of the silkiness of her coat.<br /><br />Over time, my cats started to quit eating the Innova Evo and I experimented with some of the Innova foods with some grains, but they were only mildly interested.  My cats are finicky eaters and they get tired of the same wet food after awhile.  So, I went back to giving them many varieties of Fancy Feast (they share a 3 oz can as a dinner-time treat, as most of their diet is dry food, which they love).  They had regained the weight and were healthy.<br /><br />Jump ahead seven years.  My cats are now just shy of 15, and about six months ago, I realized my boy was losing some weight. I took him to the vet, and he checked out fine - just getting older. He still loves to eat, so I decided it was time to pack in more nutrition and calories in what he eats. Given my prior positive experience with Innova Evo, I went back to it.  My cats have again taken to it well, and my little boy has gradually regained some weight.  (Both cats remain active, racing through the house, playing, etc.) When I went to get the Innova, I was thrilled to find that there were more flavors of Innova available than I could find seven years ago (might just have been the pet store I used).  Perfect!  With the variety of flavors, I've been able to provide them some variety in their diet, while still knowing they're getting nutritious food (the regular Innova has grains, but is still a well-balanced, superior cat food, and I work the Innova Evo in as much as I can).<br /><br />When I changed my cats' wet food to Innova, I realized they also made a dry food with salmon and herring (my cats are seafood lovers, with chix as a second choice).  I got them started on the Innova dry food and they love it, too!

The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored. Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas. He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us. We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room. The smell of peppermint was overpowering. It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint. What a rush! The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry. For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea. Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder. The events of that day have changed my life forever.

I do know that there are a lot of fake products out there, and with such a high percentage of the wrong color seeds, it made me doubt the entire delivery.<br />With that doubt I can't justify a better rating.

I had to finally give up and look for bags.  This product is great!  The nylon bags and fresh tasting tea do the trick!  You can even do the faux pas two steeps before trashing with a little flavor still coming out!  Even with water normally too hot for green teas, the result is a smooth, low tannin flavor.  There are a few downfalls, however...<br /><br />Although each tin has a generous amount of tea bags, there is NO air tight seal.  You rely on whatever reduction in air exchange through the tight fitting aluminum lid.  Once you open this 60-bag pack, therefore, try to drink it quickly.  If you drink a lot of tea, this may not be a problem.  Oxygen in the air catalyzes rapid degradation!<br /><br />That being said, the tea, so far, is still wonderful after a couple month of usage (down to 1 tin!).<br /><br />Another issue, I like my tea to have a little stronger flavor than these bags allow.  It may be a product of the amount of tea in the bags, but even steeping in boiling water for over 10 minutes does not extract a ton of flavor.  If you're looking for a VERY light tea, this will not be a problem for you.<br /><br />I've adjusted my drink schedule and switched to my strongly caffeinated, stoutly flavored coffee for workday mornings and this delightfully light tea for weekends.<br /><br />In summary, this tea is quite fresh and tasty with almost no bitter tannin flavor, though comes with no airtight seals and brews a little weak for me.

During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.",Positive,,,zz,0.226085402,0.103771087,0.256739746,0.213014795,0.104978919,0.218967006,0.140096886,0.256739746,3,Flavor/Taste,,,,

They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.

I got the chicken flavor (despite other claims of serious odor) because it was the cheapest flavor. My dog LOVES them. Her affinity for them, coupled with their size makes them perfect for training.  They are small little cylinders which are about 1/4"" thick and less than 1/2"" wide. They are enough to keep her interest, but not too substantial that they distract from training as she's chewing, as usually happens with a biscuit-type treat. They are also great for use inside the Kong Genius Leo (I have a size Large). They are thinner than a similar treat by a different brand which I found at my local Petco. I like that they're smaller because the other ones would get stuck in the tube of the Leo. These slide in and out without much friction at all. I don't find the odor to be as offensive as others have described. The odor is about average for moist treats, in my opinion. In fact, they smell very similar to my cat's treats.  So much so that my cat tries to steal them when I lay them on the floor while the dog is practicing ""stay.""  Also, you really can't beat the value!

Be aware of smaller size though.,"This Kraft Mac and Cheese is trying to stand out in the marketplace by using cauliflower pasta.  Don't worry if you dislike cauliflower- this tastes the same as standard Mac and Cheese pasta.  You do cook it for a minute less than the regular product.<br /><br />While you may be interested in buying this in order to get the vegetable serving, keep in mind you are paying about the same price for a smaller box (5.5 oz vs 7.25 oz).  The silver lining in this is that the calories in an entire prepared box are much lower in this veggie version (750 vs 1200 calories).<br /><br />This product may be useful for sneaking veggies into a kid's diet.
